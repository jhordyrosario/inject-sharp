# InjectSharp
Simple Dependency Injection implementation for educational and demonstration purposes

InjectSharp is a simple, educational dependency injection (DI) framework for .NET applications. This project is designed to demonstrate how dependency injection works in a straightforward and accessible manner, making it ideal for educational purposes and for those interested in understanding the core concepts of DI without the overhead of more complex frameworks.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing for better modularity and making the code easier to manage and test. DI enables the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes them manageable through external means.

## Key Components

- **Container**: The DI container is a central place where the components and their dependencies are registered. The container is responsible for the creation and injection of instances wherever needed.

- **Builder**: In InjectSharp, the `ContainerGenerator` acts as a builder that collects all the dependencies and constructs a container from them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core 3.1 or later / .NET 5 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (recommended for development)

## Features
**Simple DI Container:** Easy to use and lightweight, with basic DI capabilities.
**Service Registration:** Support for registering services and their implementations.
**Instance Creation:** Automatic creation of service instances when required.

## Educational Purpose
This library is created strictly for educational purposes to show how dependency injection frameworks are typically implemented in a simplified form. It is ideal for those new to software design patterns or those interested in learning the internal workings of a DI framework.

This README outlines the project, provides basic usage examples, and explains the educational purpose behind InjectSharp. Adjust as needed to match the actual structure and URLs of your project repository.
